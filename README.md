# Introduction
In today's data-driven world, effectively visualizing complex relational and high-dimensional data is crucial for gaining insights and making informed decisions. We aim to design and implement a comprehensive system for visualizing such data, spanning from basic graph drawing to advanced techniques. To experience the design progress of the algorithms and understand the logic more deeply, we avoid applying any visualizing library but set up the program by sorting datasets into the adjacency matrix and direction list.

# simple guide
The implementation unfolds across distinct steps, each addressing different aspects of data visualization. This journey encompasses a comprehensive exploration of diverse visualization methods from the deep bottom of data architecture to the implementation of algorithms by ourselves, including: 

✔️Basic graph drawing using user-defined layouts
✔️Force-directed layouts
✔️DFS/BFS bubble-tree layouts
✔️Sugiyama-inspired layouts for directed graph
✔️Multi-layer layouts with cross-layer edge bundling
✔️Graph projections for high-dimension data
